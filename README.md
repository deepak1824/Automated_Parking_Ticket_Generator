# Automated_Parking_Ticket_Generator
Automated Parking Ticket Generator using altera cyclone II FPGA


The design is based on a FPGA board integrated with couple of detectors such as RFID/IR sensor which will detect the computerized number plate of the car to send the information to the Office of Parking Violation, if the car was parked at an illegal parking spot. 

- Designed state machine to enumerate different parking spots.
- Developed C code and used AT commands to configure ESP8266.
- Integrated the functioning of ESP8266 with the FPGA.
- Tool: Intel Quartus, Language: Verilog.
